 # GO_TO_THE_MOON

## This is the prototype of GTM(Go to the Moon)'s Blockchain-based Patient Consent application.
### Hackathon 2021 Winter

## What we have done
Using React, we have attempted to create a website that manages patients' medical data based on blockchain technology. Although we didn't complete it, we were able to complete the various things we aimed for.

- First, when a patient joins our website, the user has a block and gets the Hash value accordingly.

- Second, patients can enter their personal information and modify it at any time. At this time, a new block is created, and at the same time, information is stored in the block with the Hash value. At this time, the blocks are connected to each other.

- Third, patients can choose the data they want to disclose. Of course, modifications can be made at any time and are operated with the same blockchain system. However, we could not make many check items due to the lack of time but added some important things that we thought.

- Finally, whenever patients sign up or modify our personal information, disclosure range, we create a hash value and implement it to show the timestamp, previous hash value, and current hash value when the customer finally submits it.

- There is something we have not implemented in time, which is showing the list of patients' all hash values. We will try to finish it personally later.
